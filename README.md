# what is libft?
42's first project as a cadet-- an admitted student.
It's require for all students to complete before moving on to the next project in the curriculum, and this library will be used in future projects down the line due to restrictions(libft.a).
Now, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel here, but this is how 42 believes we can learn the foundations of software engineering the best. This project gave me a better understanding of data types, memory allocation, and data structures. 

# how does it work?
We create libft.a by using the source files by doing the following:
git clone the repo
go into the libft directory
initiate the makefile

```
git clone https://github.com/YungBunny/libft
cd libft
make
```

You should see a libft.a file and some object files (.o).
To clean up (removing the .o files and the .c files from the root), call `<addr>`make clean`<addr>`
WARNING: make clean will delete all your files from your root directory.
